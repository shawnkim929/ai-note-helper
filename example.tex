\section{Introduction}

This is a simple example. Clearly, uniform continuity is important.

\section{Main Results}

We need to show that $f$ is uniformly continuous. 
%!ai clarify(apply=true, max_tokens=150): "Provide a step-by-step proof outline for showing uniform continuity, focusing on the key steps without going into full detail."
%!ai-begin id=0b85be9b verb=clarify
```
(MODEL-PLACEHOLDER) Provide a step-by-step proof outline for showing uniform continuity, focusing on the key steps without going into full detail.
```
%!ai-end id=0b85be9b


The function $f(x) = x^2$ on $[0,1]$ is uniformly continuous.
%!ai expand(apply=false): "Explain why this is true and provide a brief justification."

\section{Conclusion}

See \ref{thm:main} for the main theorem.
